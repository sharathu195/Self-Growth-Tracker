• Reflect: Am I listening to understand or fix?

Relationship Skills:
• Ask your partner how they want to be supported when they're low.

Relationship Skills:
• Follow through on one promise or intention.

• Think about a time your partner felt unsupported. Imagine what they needed.
• Offer it now, without needing to talk about the past.

Reflection Prompts:
• Who am I when I’m alone?
• What matters most to me?

☑️ WEEK 6: ASSERTIVENESS & HONESTY
Emotional Intelligence & Empathy:
• Practice tolerating difficult emotions without reacting immediately.
• Use breathwork or mindfulness daily (10 mins).

Relationship Skills:
• Share one vulnerability openly.
• Ask: "Is there anything you’ve been holding in?"

• Let your partner have the final say in a shared decision.
• Acknowledge when you’ve made something about yourself and shift focus back to them.

Reflection Prompts:

• Focus on what your partner needs, not what you want to be seen doing.

Reflection Prompts:
• Where did I show growth?
• Where did I default to old patterns?

☑️ WEEK 8: OWNERSHIP & DIRECTION

• Review the last 7 weeks. What emotions were hardest to sit with? Which got easier?

Relationship Skills:
• Write your partner a letter summarizing how you’ve grown.
• Invite their reflection.

• Who am I?
• What do I stand for?
• What am I still figuring out?

Selflessness in Action:
• Reflect on how to be selfless without self-erasing.
• Make a commitment to one habit of generosity going forward.

🌟 Monthly Review (After 2 Months)
• What has changed in how I handle emotions?
• How has my relationship evolved?
• Do I feel more like me?
• Am I showing up in selfless ways?
• What do I want to carry forward into the next 2 months?

This plan is not a replacement for therapy, but if done sincerely, it can lay a strong foundation for emotional maturity, self-awareness, individuality, and deeper connection—with both yourself and your partner.
